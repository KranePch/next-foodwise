# FoodWise: Personalized Food Recommendation System
# Introduction
FoodWise is a cutting-edge web application designed to offer personalized food recommendations based on user preferences, leveraging Machine Learning models for intelligent suggestions. Inspired by a project aimed at tracking Amazon product prices, this initiative marks a shift towards enhancing personal dietary choices. Developed as part of my journey to deepen my expertise in NextJS, Python (specifically in Machine Learning and Flask), and MongoDB, FoodWise embodies a fusion of web development and AI technologies for a unique user experience.

#  Key Features
**Personalized Food Recommendations**: Utilizes Machine Learning models to analyze user preferences and suggest foods tailored to individual tastes.
**Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with NextJS allows easy navigation and a seamless experience on the landing page, where recommended foods are displayed.
**Food Collection**: A comprehensive and evolving collection of foods stored in MongoDB (Cloud), ensuring a wide variety of choices for recommendations. Gathering data from **Kaggle - Open Food Facts** datasets.

# Technologies
**NextJS**: Powers the frontend for a responsive and interactive web application.
**Python**: Utilized for backend logic, especially in creating and deploying Machine Learning models for food recommendation and Flask for API development.
**MongoDB**: Hosts the food database in the cloud, providing robust data management and scalability.

# Project Goals
This project aims to:

Enhance my skills in NextJS for full-stack development, Python for backend logic and Machine Learning, and MongoDB for database management.
Provide a novel approach to food recommendations, making dietary choices more personalized and data-driven.
Showcase the integration of Machine Learning with web technologies to create innovative solutions for everyday challenges.
