This project is inspired from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9XVGv6BHs.

The original one aims to track Amazon's product price, promotion, etc. 
There is a feature which allows users to provide the link for product which they would like to track.
The user is able their tracked product in a landing page, moreover for more details on each product 
the user can click on product card.

While my goals is to create food recommendation based on personal preference.
My additional feature will allows user to get suggestion food from Machine Learning models
However the link given by user from the original one will be remove, and the get suggested food will is going to replace.

The foods collection will be stored in MongoDB (Cloud).

My intend is to improve my knowledge on the following technologies:
1. NextJS
2. Python - Machine Learning, Flask
3. MongoDB
